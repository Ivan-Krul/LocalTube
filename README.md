# LocalTube
HTML page for watching all your video content in your compute in local harddrive without any problems.
It doesn't read from other drive because it's prioritised for... well... web.
# Functionality
It also has:
- filter by title or path
- acceptable style of page
- shuffler
- recommendation and previews(it's just also a videos)
- user profiling with importing and exporting user data
- rating videos
- set up ignore.txt and/or pathToCheckItOut.txt to set up WritePathsToContent.ps1 to generate content.txt what contains all paths to videos for LocalTube page.
# Set up
You just need to get only Powershell to work propertly, and basically that's not all, just launch Powershell script called WritePathsToVideo.ps1 and you have done!
But Hold on, if you're working with videos what located not in web servers, then **don't forget to turn off CORS technology in your browser because the page wouldn't work properly!**
But basically that's all!!
